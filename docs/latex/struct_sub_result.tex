\subsection{Detailed Description}
This class holds all of the methods for executing the long subtraction. 

\subsection{D\+E\+S\+C\+R\+I\+P\+T\+I\+ON}\label{namespacestd_DESCRIPTION}
This class contains all of the methods needed for checking and subtracting one \doxyref{Big\+Integer}{p.}{class_big_integer} value from another. It does so using a form of long subtraction. Essentially it iterates through the array in reverse order, going from the last digit to the first, subtracting one value at a time. If the combined value of subtracting the digits exceeds a two digit result, only the last digit of the result is returned and the other numbers are added to the following calculation as a carry over value. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
