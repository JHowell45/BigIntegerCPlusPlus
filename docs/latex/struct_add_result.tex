\subsection{Detailed Description}
This class holds all of the methods for executing the long addition. 

\subsection{D\+E\+S\+C\+R\+I\+P\+T\+I\+ON}\label{namespacestd_DESCRIPTION}
This class contains all of the methods needed for checking and adding two integer values together. This class takes two integers provided by another class and runs a form of long division. This means that if the value ends up being two digits or increasing by greater than the value of 10, it adds 1 to the remainder value. A struct. This struct is used for storing the result returned by adding the first and second value and also the remainder.
